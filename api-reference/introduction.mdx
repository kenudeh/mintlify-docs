This is the reference documentation for the Dolphin Flashcard API. To make navigation easier, the enpoints are grouped into four sections: Account, Card management, Goals, and Statistics.

Our API allows you to set up user accounts, create and manage flashcards, set learning goals, and track performances with the data from a user's heatmap and streak. Data is available in JSON format only. <br></br>

**Note**: All parameters are case-sensitive. Request body parameters are required, but query string parameters are optional.
