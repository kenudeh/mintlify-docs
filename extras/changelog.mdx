## 3.4.0 - 2024-06-15

### Changed

### Fixed

- Fixed some issues in pipelines

## 3.3.0 - 2024-06-15

### Added

- Added unit tests for `create-folder` endpoint

## 3.1.0 - 2024-06-10

### Added

- New `CreateFlashcardSetDialogue` modal to handle creating a flashcard set
- Added a basic edit-flashcard page  with most features and API calls unimplemented which the `CreateFlashcardSetDialogue` modal takes the user to when a flashcard is created. The page can be passed `newSet`, which if true, won't request flashcard data from the server. When implementing the edit-flashcard page fully, the page should use the API to read flashcard details when `newSet` is not true
- Added basic `CreateFolderDialogue` modal, which does not work yet

### Changed

- Updated `CONTRIBUTING.md` to reflect the latest database changes

## 3.0.1 - 2024-06-07

### Added

## 3.0.0 - 2024-06-05

### Added

- Seperated concrete database implementation classes from api methods to seperate classes in `database/handlers`
- Added much more unit tests, and made the pipeline run all unit tests
- Added methods to help with unit tests like /api/get-user-stats

### Changed

- Switched to Firebase Firestore instead of Firebase Database to allow referencing data, not just embedding - leading to greater scaliability
- Changed frontend to interact with the new database

### Removed

- Deprecated /api/calculate-card-stats - this will now be done by the client to improve speed
- Deprecated /api/get-weekly-xp and /api/get-total-xp - the frontend calculates them at the same time, so it makes sense to use /api/get-user-stats to pull this data instead
